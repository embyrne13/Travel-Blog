        So happy you're here! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name
        is Emily. I am a New York native and I LOVE to travel. I spent a year
        and a half living in Spain where I got to immerse in the culture and
        travel throughout Europe. I have been to 17 countries so far and hope to
        get to many more soon.
