        So happy you're here! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name
        is Emily. I am a New York native and I love to travel. I spent a year
        and a half living in Spain where I immersed in the culture and travelled
        throughout Europe. I have been to 17 countries so far and hope to get to
        many more soon. My next planned trip is to Peru!
